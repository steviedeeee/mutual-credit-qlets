<FONT SIZE=+3>The Qlets Internet Project</FONT><FONT SIZE=+2> &nbsp; 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></FONT>When Qlets version 1.0 was first developed in 1993,
it aimed to address basic issues: &nbsp;how to facilitate administrations
where software functionality had been limited and problematic. It's hard
to believe, but in 1993 there were only 50 websites <I>worldwide. </I>The
following year a small group of NCSA developers formed the Netscape Communications
Corporation, and the rest, as they say, is history.</P>

<P>Qlets has just completed a major revision in its version 8 release:
the first architecture for multiple currency management that is both powerfully
flexible and user-friendly. We believe that its functionality is unmatched
among softwares of its kind, as are the resources and time currently allocated
to the project. As the oldest local currency software in continuous development,<I>
</I>Qlets has achieved a rare level of functionality and maturity.&nbsp;Yet
despite this achievement, it has yet to really tap into the net.</P>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></FONT></FONT>Local currency administrators are not technology
experts, but their systems usually have some - one reason we supply source
code to Qlets for troubleshooting by local programmers. But over the years,
we've run across a central confusion that software <I>is equivalent</I>
with data, rather than a tool for using it.</P>

<P>Your system data is not software: &nbsp;you can open it, or transfer
it using any computer language, either directly or mediated through software,
whether it is software you design or an off-the-shelf package. Qlets itself
is DOS-based software that uses DBF files to store your system data. The
DBF (database file) format was first introduced with Dbase and carried
through related language environments like Foxpro and Clipper, and became
ubiquitous to the point where most computer languages support it, either
directly (as with Visual Basic, Access, Paradox, or Foxpro) or through
ODBC (Open Database Connectivity), as with Java and a wide variety of RAD
tools (rapid application tools) thst support the ODBC standard. </P>

<P>This means your Qlets data can be used unaltered (used directly) in
many different application development environments, or any software you
develop to provide a custom function that we haven't yet designed. For
instance, Cold Fusion is a RAD tool for connecting ODBC - compatible databases
(such as those in Qlets) as a website backend, and constructing the website
search engines needed to open up your data for online use by LETS members.
(Cold Fusion is an excellent development tool but is expensive and platform-specific
to Windows. We're currently immersing in Java, a powerful, platform-independent
and freely distributed developer environment.) </P>

<P>Some of our next software releases will likely be written in Java, but
we won't be duplicating what Qlets can already do; simply using a new language
<B><I>to access the same data</I></B> for different purposes, specific
to the internet.&nbsp;And the rapid rise of internet protocols means that
new and evolving programming environments <I>must</I> be used to integrate
your existing data with the net.</P>

<P>We're currently working on companion software that can use your existing
data to automate certain internet-related functions, including:</P>

<UL>
<LI>completion of a &quot;mailbot&quot; utility to allow separate Qlets
copies to interact as a multiLETS (currently, a single Qlets copy can administer
many systems, but parallel copies can't work in tandem)</LI>

<LI>completion of a broadcast emailer to automate digital delivery of account
statements and ad directories</LI>

<LI>completion of Qlets-to-web connections for data entry through a website
and web publication of ad directories</LI>

<LI>completion of a Visual Basic conversion utility for those that are
more comfortable working with within Qlets data from within MS Access</LI>
</UL>

<P>For customizing Qlets at the local level, we provide source code to
registered users. This allows local programmers to troubleshoot or extend
the software's ability as required.</P>

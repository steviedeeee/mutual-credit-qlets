Shooting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></FONT>If Qlets doesn't start up when you attempt to run
QLETS.EXE, you may have to tweak some settings. The most common problem
is a memory conflict on older machines running Windows 3.1 or DOS. The
following section is reprinted from the User Manual (QMANUAL.DOC), that
comes bundled in the download zipfile. </P>

</P>

<P>The single persistant problem with QLETS revolves around corruption
of index files, extension .MDX or .NDX. Theses files appear in virgin form
in the download copy after it's unpacked (by clicking on the download file,
which is self-extracting).<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
Corrupted index files can cause the appearance of incorrect ads, trades,
or memo/list information attributed to accounts, and is the first indication
of a problem. First run Reindex under Special Tools and look for an error
message. Almost always, such files are corrupted due to an improper shutdown,
a hardware conflict, or another circumstance that requires rebooting the
computer while QLETS is still running. This event can cause imcomplete
records that have a variety of random characters, and may be missing key
information needed by the index files, depending on where the program code
was waiting and which database files may have been open at that point.</P>

<P>It is possible to repair all corrupted index files by using the following
instructions:</P>

<P>1) move all of your old QLETS files into a directory called C:\QL17
(you may have to create it). This directory is read first when searching
for older QLETS copies using the Convert Data option (below), to extract
their current data into clean files.<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
2) download the most current <A HREF="index.html">Full Version</A> of QLETS
from our website and save it in C:\QL8<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
3) click on the download file (Q8FULL.EXE), to unpack it into C:\QL8<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
4) run the newly downloaded version at C:\QL8\QLETS.EXE<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
5) Use the Convert Data option under Special Tools (if you have problems
with the password, the default is a blank line so hit Enter). Then choose
QLETS - Earlier Versions by hitting Q.<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
6) Your current data is then extracted from C:\QL17 into clean files properly
indexed.</P>

<P>In case you still experience difficulty, simply email me the zipped
versions of the data files I request, and I'll have a look at them manually
and repair any bad records, then email themback. Currently I'm at sparky@pipcom.com.<BR CLEAR=BOTH>

the Virtual Memory Manager 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></FONT></FONT></B>A virtual memory manager (VMM) is included
with QLETS to help it to run concurrently with other software in Windows
3.1. By using the VMM, memory requirements for Qlets are much reduced.
The VMM is currently set for a typical 4 RAM machine (you can edit the
settings by opening QLETS.VMM in a text editor), but can be set for as
little as 2 RAM. It may conflict with disk-caching software like SMARTDRIVE,
however, a common disk-cache that may well be running on your system. (SMARTDRIVE.EXE
is shipped with Microsoft Windows). If you are unable to start up QLETS,
it's likely due to this memory conflict. There are two ways to fix it,
should this happen to you. You can: </P>

<P>1) disable SMARTDRIVE (or whatever disk-caching program is running on
your system), or <BR clear=both>
2) disable the VMM supplied with QLETS (by erasing the QLETS.VMC) </P>

<P><BR CLEAR=BOTH>
<A NAME="dis_smart"></A><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="3dleft.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=26></A><FONT COLOR="#808000"><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;Disabling
the SMARTDRIVE Disk Cache 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></FONT></FONT>Disabling SMARTDRIVE involves editing your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file, to convert the line that loads it into a comment. For
example, my AUTOEXEC file contained the line: </P>

<P>C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE 1024 256 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>which
was changed to: <BR clear=both>
</B>REM C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE 1024 256 </P>

<P>It's useful, but not essential, to edit the QLETS.VMC file, (you can
use any text editor, like Notepad, for example) which contains explanations
of the settings. If the QLETS.VMC file is present - ie. not erased - then
the VMM will be activated whenever Qlets is started. The MAXMEM and MINMEM
settings in the VMM can be altered to suit your RAM. For information on
SMARTDRIVE, type &quot;help&quot; from the c:\ and look at the entry describing
it. The downside of disabling SMARTDRIVE (and using the Qlets VMM instead),
is slightly slower computer operation, especially when groups of files
are copied or moved. The upside is you'll be able to use Alt-Tab in Windows
to switch between other software and Qlets while keeping them all running
at once. </P>

the Qlets Virtual Memory Manager 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></FONT></FONT>The other option is to keep SMARTDRIVE in
place, and remove the file QLETS.VMC from the C:\QL8 directory instead.
This will disable the Qlets virtual memory manager. You must then add the
following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>SET DOS16M=:2M</B></P>

<P>This is a DOS environmental variable that sets how much extended memory
is available for DOS-based programs. For users with little RAM, disabling
the VMM this way means that Qlets must run alone from the DOS prompt. <BR CLEAR=BOTH>

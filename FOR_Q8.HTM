version 8 for the first time, or the EXE only (<B>q8only.exe) </B>if you've
previously installed version 8 and want to preserve your existing data.
Both of these files are &quot;self-extracting&quot;: when you run them
they unpack themselves into whatever directory you left them in (you should
put them in a directory called C:\QL8). The only difference between the
two versions offered is that one contains sample data files and the other
doesn't.</P>

<P><B>Why download the EXE separately? <BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>Downloading only the EXE file allows you to upgrade often, providing
a faster response time to delivering bug fixes, and it should be your preferred
download method once you've installed the full version 8 at least once,
for the following reasons:</P>

<UL>
<LI>We'll be offering revised versions of the EXE free on a regular basis.
</LI>

<LI>Downloading it separately protects whatever system data you currently

Currencies<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</FONT></FONT>___________________________________________________________________________<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
Five (fictional) currency systems come loaded in the software, and we recommend
that you keep the fictional data intact until you've run the following
tutorial. (When you're ready to use the program with live data, see <B>Unloading
the Fictional Accounts</B> later in this section).</P>

<P><B>Multiple Transaction Records<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>This section and those to follow assume you've installed the software
and can start it up without problems (if it doesn't run, click <A HREF="trouble.htm">here</A>).
First, we'll find a sample account: try&nbsp;<B>Lookup / ID / 4</B>, then
click on <B>Trades</B>.<B> </B>You should see a small &quot;popup&quot;
at right, listing the five (fictional) currency systems that come loaded
in the program.</P>

<P>Those familiar with older Qlets software versions will recognize this
as a fundamental change from the past: a single account may now have multiple
trade records, depending on how many currency systems they participate
in.</P>

<P><B>Navigating Between Currencies<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>For now, click on &quot;City LETS&quot;. This will show us the trade
record for ID 4 within the City LETS system. The resulting screen (generally
called the &quot;transaction screen&quot;) is used for displaying, adding,
or navigating through trades in various curriencies. For instance, click
on <B>Currency</B>. Once again, you'll see the popup at right listing currency
systems. Click on one from the list, and the transaction screen for that
currency will pop up.</P>

<P><B>Adding a Transaction<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>Note that whatever currency you're currently working with is the one
chosen when you select <B>Add Trade</B>. For instance, if the top of screen
shows &quot;PL currency trades&quot; then the PL currency (Provincial LETS,
in the sample accounts), is the one that will be used for the trade you're
entering.</P>

<P>In case you're lost at this point, the steps taken to enter a new transaction
are:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Lookup </B>an account</LI>

<LI>click on <B>Trades</B></LI>

<LI>Select the currency system from the list</LI>

<LI>If the account has traded in the currency, the transaction screen pops
up. Select <B>Add Trade</B>.<B> </B>Otherwise you'll get a message &quot;No
trades found in XX currency. F5: enter new trade&quot;</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Assigning Membership for One Account<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>After you've found the account you want using <B>Lookup</B>, click
on <B>Member Of</B> to set membership(s) for that person. You'll wind up
at the &quot;member groups&quot; screen, which has a long row of &nbsp;yes/no
values at left. Each &quot;Y&quot; means this person belongs to the member
group listed (a &quot;N&quot; means they don't). Notice that a single account
can therefore belong to some, none, or all of the member groups listed.
To change the membership(s) for this account, click on <B>Edit Y/N</B>.
(Ctrl-End is a shortcut to finish).</P>

<P><B>Assigning Membership for All Accounts<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>The method just described can assign membership for one account only.
What if you want to assign <B>all </B>memberships for a single group? In
that case, click on the buttons marked <B>All Yes Group </B>or <B>All No
Group</B>. These two buttons are used to assign membership for every account
in your database. For example, suppose you have just created a member group
called &quot;National LETSystem&quot;, with a currency called <B>NL</B>.
You want the group's currency to be used (or usable) by everyone - no restrictions.
By hitting <B>All Yes Group</B> you can assign a &quot;yes&quot; beside
the National LETSystem for every account in your database. This way, when
charges, lists, Ad Directories, etc. are produced for the National LETSystem,
they will include everyone (note that you can always remove a person from
inclusion by putting a <B>N</B> beside the group name in their account).</P>

<P>The <B>All No Group </B>button is useful when you're running out of
room for new member groups, and decide to type over an old one. After you've
changed the group name, use <B>All No Group </B>to be sure it starts off
with a blank slate (ie. no members assigned).</P>

<P><B>What is a &quot;Member Group&quot;?<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>Users of older versions will recognize that member groups appear similar
to what were once called <B>Projects</B>. In fact, the old &quot;projects
screen&quot; was retooled and renamed, and <B>Member Groups </B>are what
resulted.&nbsp;A member group<B> </B>in Qlets can be of two types: one
that administers a local currency (ie. a LETS or Hours system), and one
that doesn't. In the sample data, you'll notice that the first eight member
groups shown have &quot;<B>does not administer</B>&quot;<B> </B>listed
under the column called <B>Currency</B>. By contrast, the last five member
groups each show a two-letter code under the Currency column (and an ID
listed under <B>Home Account</B>).</P>

<P>That's the crucial difference that the software looks for, when dealing
with member groups: whether or not a <B>Currency </B>and<B> Home Account
</B>is associated with the group. If it is, the software assumes the group
is a local currency system. (Note: it's important that you don't duplicate
any entries under the Currency column. For instance, you don't want two
groups each administering the <B>GR </B>currency).</P>

<P><BR CLEAR=BOTH>
<B>Unloading the Fictional Accounts<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>When you're satisfied that you understand the basics of Qlets, you
should remove the fictional accounts in preparation for working with real
data. There are two ways to do this:</P>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>Special Tools / Unload the Fictional Accounts</LI>

<LI>Special Tools / Convert Data / Qlets [earlier versions]</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>You must use <B>Unload the Fictional Accounts </B>if you are a first-time
Qlets user (ie. you have no previous version of the software on your machine).
If you have an earlier version of Qlets, and <I>have real system data </I>in
it, you should use the <B>Convert Data </B>option.</P>

<P><B>Converting your System Data<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>This<B> </B>option <I>will not affect </I>your original data: it can
be used safely and without worries. <B>Convert Data</B> merely makes copies
of your original data in the format used by version 8. <BR CLEAR=BOTH>
<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
<B>Note:</B> do not attempt to copy your original data files manually into
C:\QL8. Their &quot;data structure&quot; is not the same, and version 8
will crash if you attempt this. Similarly, using <B>Restore from Backup</B>
will crash the software if your backup was made with an earlier version.
Using <B>Convert Data </B>is the only safe way to port your old system
data into the new version.</P>

<P><A NAME="charging"></A><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="3dleft.gif" ALT="top" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=26></A><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><FONT COLOR="#808000"><FONT SIZE=+3>New
Charging Abilities<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</FONT></FONT>Charging in Qlets now covers a dizzying array of possible
charge combinations: there are five different basic charge types, each
with their own options. Further, each charge can be combined with any combination
of the others, and charged to any of 18 possible currency systems! Sound
confusing? We hope this section helps.</P>

<P><B>The Five Basic Charge Types<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>Charge types can be:</P>

<UL>
<LI>&quot;flat&quot; fees</LI>

<LI>advertising fees</LI>

<LI>demurrage fees</LI>

<LI>fees per transaction</LI>

<LI>percentage fees on overall trading</LI>
</UL>

<P>Perhaps the best way to explain the charges is to play around with <B>Revenue
Projections</B>: a feature that lets you test any combination of charges
(<B>without</B> actually charging anyone), to see what kinds of revenues
would result. To try a revenue projection, use <B>Filter</B>, then <B>Member
Group</B>, and select one of the groups with a currency value listed (ie.
City LETS (GR) - the abbreviated currency codes only appear next to member
groups that administer currencies). Finally, click on <B>Charging</B>.</P>

<P>Before you begin setting up the revenue projection, the software asks
if you'd like to <B>Reindex </B>your data first. Reindexing is a useful
option that's also available from the <B>Special Tools </B>menu. Essentially,
reindexing insures that your data's Ok (it will pause if there's a problem,
in which case you'll probably want to restore some files from the backup
disks you've made using <B>Special Tools / Make Backup Disks</B>).</P>

<P>After you've decided whether to Reindex or not, the charge selection
process begins: you'll see a screen asking which types of charges you want
to run (put a &quot;<B>Y</B>&quot; beside those you want). The &quot;home
account&quot; ID is listed at bottom: this is where any revenue will be
sent (you can enter an alternate ID if you'd like: you may have set up
some special account to collect particular fees [ie. demurrage fees]. Note
that if you're running a <B>revenue projection </B>only the home account
doesn't matter: revenue will be counted up for display purposes, but no
real charge records will be created).</P>

<P>After you've decided which of the five charge types to use, other options
will appear to further refine your selection. For instance, if you said
&quot;yes&quot; to &quot;ad charges&quot;, you're then asked if you want
the ad charge done &quot;per word&quot; or &quot;per character&quot;. Then
you're asked if any <B>free </B>words or characters should apply, before
the charge is calculated.</P>

<P>This process of refining your charge selection continues for each type
of charge:</P>

<UL>
<LI>flat fees prompt for a description and amount</LI>

<LI>demurrage fees ask what percentage, and what the &quot;cutoff&quot;
balance is</LI>

<LI>percentage charges ask you what percent to use</LI>

<LI>per transaction charges ask for the rate per trade</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>About &quot;Flat&quot; Charges<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>A flat charge is simply a charge that applies equally to all &quot;open&quot;
accounts (a person's account <B>status </B>can be <B>open, closed, inactive,
</B>or<B> &quot;no deliv&quot; </B>[ie. an open account that doesn't want
any printed materials delivered - such accounts will not generate a printed
account statement or mailing label, effectively removing them from your
distribution system]).</P>

<P>Typically, flat charges are used monthly (ie. $1 per month per member),
but you can also charge them annually, bimonthly, or at any pace you determine.
Further charges for special services (bike delivery of their Ad Directory
and account statement, for instance) are often combined with a flat monthly
charge. Such extra charges are made convenient when you create a <B>member
group </B>specifically for the charge. For instance, you can create a group
called <B>Bike Delivery</B>, then assign accounts to the group using the
method described in <B>Assigning Membership for One Account </B>(above).
When you're ready to run the special charge for that service, simply <B>Filter
/ Member Group / &quot;Bike Delivery&quot; / Charging</B>. Member groups
such as these do not administer currency systems, but they're useful for
saving you time: no need to charge each member individually, for groups
of accounts who regularly receive a special service.</P>

<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
<B>Mousing Around<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>You can mouse-click your way through most of the menus now (clicking
outside of a menu often acts like hitting 'ESC', but not always. For instance,
if you click on <B>Filter</B>, then click somewhere other than the Filter
menu, the menu vanishes as if you'd hit ESC). If you have trouble getting
the mouse to work you may have to ensure that a mouse driver is loaded
from DOS prior to starting Windows (ie. from your <B>autoexec </B>file;
for other tips on altering your system files click <A HREF="trouble.htm">here</A>).</P>

<P><B>New Mailing Label Options<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>Print-to-file and optional blank line(s) inserted between each mailing
label. Labels still print in the &quot;single roll&quot; format; we haven't
yet tackled the &quot;three across&quot; variety.</P>

<P><B>&quot;Check Window&quot; Option to Verify Charge Calculations<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>The &quot;check window&quot; can be turned on prior to running charges
(or a revenue projection) for any currency system. The check window pauses
after each portion of revenue is calculated, showing the account involved,
the source data (ie. the ads or trades for that account), plus a summary
of calculations. You can turn off the check window during calculations
by hitting F10, and the charges / revenue projection will continue uninterrupted.</P>

<P><B>Selected Charges Shown with Final Revenue<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>The complexity of charging in version 8 (five different charge/credit
types, each with their own cutoff levels and other options), requires a
more organized approach. To help you achieve that, the mixture of charge
rate options you select is now kept on-screen (along with revenue). As
always, we recommend you run a <B>revenue projection </B>prior to running
real charges.</P>

<P><B>Summary Category Format Changed<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>A &quot;summary&quot; category is used to generate a special Ad Directory.</P>

<P><B>Count Utility Upgraded<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>The &quot;count&quot; utility has been expanded to include <B>inactive
</B>accounts, reintroduced for version 8.</P>

<P><B>Error Sound Shutoff<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>There's now an option to shut off the warning sound during compilation
of an Ad Directory. Some systems consciously preserve so many mismatched
phone numbers and ads from closed accounts that pre-publication was becoming
a noisy affair.</P>

<P><B>Date Format for European Users<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</B>Using &nbsp;&lt;Special Tools / Program Setup / Misc. Settings&gt;
you can now toggle the date format between North American (month / day
/ year) and European (day / month / year) formats.</P>

<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
<B>1</B>) When running charges, you can send resulting revenue to a system
account that does not exist.</P>

<P>This may be an unavoidable consequence of the fact that you now have
the power to redirect charge revenue, before charges are run, to any account
you specify. The option was included because of suggestions that a special
&quot;demurrage account&quot; be used to track revenue from demurrage fees.
You can create such an account through normal means [Add Member], and record
a trade between that account and the system account of your choice, should
you want to track demurrage fees explicitly.</P>

<P><B>2</B>) You can't run &quot;parallel copies&quot; of the software.
In other words, if you have three currency systems, all of them can't be
running Qlets 8 (at present). We hope to have email file exchange options

some screens were so fundamental that the Help sections must be rewritten.
For now, <B>this document </B>is your only source of tutorial information
concerning Qlets 8).</P>

<P><B>6</B>) The running total for &quot;amount traded&quot; no longer
appears on a member's account screen when you're running multiple currencies
through the software.</P>

<P><B>7</B>) When you create a new account, it isn't automatically assigned
as a member of any currency system. You'll have to remember to use&nbsp;the

<P><B>New Backup to Drive</B> rather than to floppy only (similar for <B>Restore

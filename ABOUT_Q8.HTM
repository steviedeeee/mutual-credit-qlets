<P><FONT FACE="Arial">DATA CONVERSION FROM OLDER VERSIONS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The software installs into c:\ql8, so it doesn't
overwrite your current version. However, to transfer data from the older
version you use the option SPECIAL TOOLS / CONVERT DATA / QLETS VERSIONS
1.0 TO 1.7 (merely copying files from the older directory won't work).
Your original files aren't altered when you use the CONVERT DATA option.
Be sure you're running version 8 when you convert your data! (Version 1.7
has the same option, but it would search for [even older] versions 1.6,
1.5, and so on. Using the CONVERT DATA option in version 1.6 won't work
for that reason). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When starting up the new version, remember it's in
a new directory - c:\ql8. Find the QLETS.exe file there and run it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">NOTE: for those who used the CONVERT DATA / MLETS
option in version 1.6 The conversion didn't automatically convert names
to uppercase, which made LOOKUP erratic. In version 8, you should choose
SPECIAL TOOLS / REINDEX DATABASES, which fixes the problem by converting
names to uppercase. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="3dleft.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=26></A><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+3>
<A NAME="begin"></A></FONT>QLETS FOR BEGINNERS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">QLETS is software that maintains a database of people,
their skills, ads, and trading. It publishes &quot;Ad Directories&quot;,
mailing labels, &quot;statements of account&quot;, and handles exotic LETSystem
needs like special charge groups (ie. for renting a booth at the Trade
Fair), running a bike courier or email delivery system (for statements
and Ad Directories), analyzing trade patterns, maintaining lists, memos,
and reminders. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">THE MAIN SCREEN</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The main screen has four options, and it's what you
see first when you start the software:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">LOOKUP used to find someone (it could be a member,
or just someone whose phone number and memo notes you need)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FILTER used to publish things, analyze trading, advertising,
etc.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ADD MEMBER used to add someone to the database</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SPECIAL TOOLS used for program setup and maintenance</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">LOOKUP: THE GATEWAY TO INFORMATION</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In your day-to-day work, you will overwhelmingly
use the option LOOKUP. This option is used for data-entry (new ads, address
changes, etc.), for editing existing information, and for viewing most
data. When you LOOKUP someone, you get access to the memos, ads, trades,
and everything else that's associated with them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">LOOKUP is the gateway to all information about an
account. For example, hit L for</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">LOOKUP. The &quot;lookup menu&quot; appears, showing
the different options you can use to look things up. You can hit F1 for
help (notice the reminder &quot;help: F1&quot; appeared at the bottom of
the screen), to give you more information about using LOOKUP. To exit help,
hit ESC (the ESC key means, roughly, &quot;go back&quot; to the previous
screen).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="3dleft.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=26></A><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+3>
<A NAME="keyword"></A></FONT>THE KEYWORD SEARCH: FINDING AN ADVERTISED
ITEM</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">One LOOKUP method is the &quot;keyword search&quot;
- hit F9 to try it. This option searches only the ads: it's a method for
pinpointing items found in the collective advertising of all members.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At the screen bottom, you'll see a box asking for
the keyword to search for. As an example, enter the word &quot;THE&quot;
and hit ENTER. The software then begins searching, and every matching ad
with &quot;the&quot; in it is found. You'll see a screen with the first
matching ad shown. Click on NEXT and you'll flip to the next matching ad.
To learn more about the keyword search, click on ABOUT THIS SCREEN. Normally,
of course, you would choose a more meaningful keyword: &quot;strollers&quot;,
for instance (if you're looking for baby strollers), or &quot;saxophone&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">THE AD / SKILL LISTS: ANOTHER WAY TO FIND ITEMS OR
SERVICES</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The &quot;Ad / Skill Lists&quot; are a LOOKUP option
similar to the keyword search. They're faster to use, but a little less
exact. They call up an entire &quot;category&quot; or ads for viewing.
For instance, everyone who's advertising in &quot;Computer Repair&quot;
can be viewed at a glance. Both the keyword search and the ad/skill lists
display the advertiser's &quot;region&quot; (ie. their neighbourhood),
which helps when someone calls up asking &quot;Who does computer repair?&quot;.
You can tell them who in their neighbourhood offers the service.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">That's the most common use for the ad/skill lists:
answering quickly in response to a phone call. Remember that if you're
publishing the ads only monthly (a common way to administer a LETS), the
ads can become out-of-date quickly. It's good to have a quick LOOKUP option
to provide the most up-to-date option.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The ad/skill lists also let you surf forward and
back through the ads, and they identify any ads from &quot;closed&quot;
accounts you may have kept (these ads are error-trapped whenever you publish
a new Ad Directory using FILTER / ALL ACCOUNTS / DIRECTORY. The computer
pauses to alert you it's found an ad from a closed account, and asks if
you want to delete it, reopen the account, or keep running the ad anyway).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">One final note: it's common for ads to get entered
in &quot;strange&quot; categories. For instance, an item like &quot;bike
tools&quot; might get entered under the category for &quot;Bikes&quot;.
If you lookup the ad/skill list for &quot;Tools&quot;, you won't see the
ad for bike tools. For that reason, it's sometimes preferable to use the
keyword search for more exact results. The keyword search is also a good
way to clean up your ads (ie. search for ads entered in weird places).
For instance, if you search for &quot;child&quot; you may find entries
under &quot;Toys&quot;, &quot;Storytelling&quot;, or &quot;Misc.&quot;.
The keyword search has a utility to CHANGE CATEGORY for the ads it finds,
making ad cleanup easier.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">LOOKUP BY NAME: FINDING A PERSON</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">So much for searching ads. Let's take a look at another
common task: searching for a specific <I>person.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">From the LOOKUP menu, choose LAST NAME, then enter
&quot;CLINT&quot; (LOOKUP forces the search word into uppercase). After
you hit ENTER, you'll jump to Bill Clinton's account. This is the &quot;account
screen&quot; - one of the most heavily used screens in the program. From
here, all information about Bill Clinton can be looked at or edited. At
left you'll see a menu box containing various options.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">VIEWING ADS AND TRADES</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Click on ADS, and you'll see Bill's first ad. Hit
NEXT and you'll see his second. You can perform a number of things from
the ad screen, like enter a new one, alter its &quot;category&quot; (the
ad categories are what the software uses to sort the ads for publication;
they're also useful for viewing a whole category at once with the ad /
skill lists).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Hit ESC to exit from Bill Clinton's ads. Now choose
TRADES, and you'll see all of Bill's trading. This is also where you record
a new trade for Bill: click on ADD. Then you'll see that Bill's account
goes by several names (he has a joint holder - his partner - and a company
name). You select which name should appear in the record. Remember to hit
F1 whenever you need help (there are different help screens for each part
of the process, when you're entering a trade).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">VIEWING MEMOS FOR EACH ACCOUNT</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Go back to Bill's account screen (hit ESC till you
get there), and now click on EXPAND MEMO. The memo window, normally just
a thin line at the bottom of Bill's account screen, will jump to fill the
screen (actually, the memo window is even bigger than that: you can fit
hundreds of lines of text into it). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Every account has its own memo window, and memos
are kept separate. In other words, there are as many memos in your database
as there are members (to view them as a complete list, try FILTER / ALL
ACCOUNTS / LIST, and put a &quot;yes&quot; beside the word &quot;memos?&quot;,
when asked what you want to view).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Memos are really useful things: they can store your
thoughts on the person's services (complaints, praise), notes about current
projects they're involved in, or odd little bits of information you want
to remember but can't find a place to put anywhere (ie. the person's phone
extension number, their second mailing address, the URL of their recent
article on the internet, etc.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To edit the memo, click on it once it's &quot;expanded&quot;
(this puts you in &quot;edit mode&quot;), or hit Ctrl-Home and start typing.
To finish, hit Ctrl-End (or ESC if you don't want to save any changes).
If you're done with the memo, you can minimize back to normal size by hitting
Enter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="3dleft.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=26></A><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+3>
<A NAME="renewal"></A></FONT>MEMBERSHIP RENEWALS: WORKING THE MEMO WINDOW</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Memos are also useful when it's time for &quot;renewals&quot;.
Most LETSystems charge a membership fee to sign up. Often this fee is for
one-year membership. Unavoidably, there are cash costs - in Fed as well
as Local - for operating a LETSystem (things like postage, photocopying,
internet access, which often can't be got for Local currency), so most
LETSystems charge renewal fees to fund their operations from year to year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">QLETS has a LOOKUP option called RENEWALS (hit F7)
to help facilitate the process. The option calls up the &quot;renewals
screen&quot;, which has the familiar memo window as its central feature.
When you call up renewals, the screen jumps to the <I>most recent account
up for renewal.</I> By clicking NEXT you move &quot;forward&quot; to the
account that will expire next. Clicking PRIOR moves you back in the list,
through accounts that have recently expired. The accounts are all presorted
based on renewal date.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Notice the two dates at top right: &quot;joined on&quot;
and &quot;renew date&quot;. These dates are assigned by default whenever
you create an account (using ADD MEMBER from the main screen, to be discussed
shortly). The join date tells you when the account was created (ie. when
it was entered in the machine), and the renew date is set one year ahead.
These dates aren't carved in stone, however. When you lookup someone's
account screen, you'll notice that one of the options is called DATES /
NAMES. By clicking on it, you'll see the join/renewal dates for that account.
The left corner of the memo window is temporarily used to display some
options: F2 for edit, F1 for help, and ESC (to exit the dates box). By
hitting F2 you can manually alter the join/renewal dates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Phone numbers for these accounts are also displayed.
The idea is to call the member in question, make a note in the memo window
(ie. Jane said she'd send a cheque by July 15), then move on to the next.
Whatever memos you leave here will also show up when you LOOKUP that person's
account normally - the memos shown for each member are the same ones displayed
from their account screen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">DATES IN QLETS: NO &quot;YEAR 2000&quot; PROBLEM</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">One other thing: notice that dates in QLETS are displayed
with the century indicated (one exception is the display for trades; but
that's just cosmetic: the full century is actually stored in the trading
data). From version 1.5 onward, QLETS has anticipated the change in century,
commonly known as the &quot;year 2000 problem&quot;. Many softwares currently
in use, where year data is stored in two digits, will mistakenly assume
that year 2000 is actually 1900, causing massive dysfunction in financial
information, worldwide panic, and a generally satisfying feeling that computers
really suck after all.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="3dleft.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=26></A><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+3>
<A NAME="sortlook"></A></FONT>SORTING ACCOUNTS USING LOOKUP</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the last example, member renewals were viewed
easily because the accounts were sorted by renewal date. This feature happens
throughout the LOOKUP menu. For instance, try LOOKUP / FIRST NAME / &quot;MAR&quot;
(type this part in and hit ENTER). Because you selected &quot;first name&quot;
for the LOOKUP, that automatically becomes the sort order (at the screen
bottom you'll see &quot;accounts are sorted by: FIRST NAME&quot;).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The account retrieved by LOOKUP is the closest first-name
match for &quot;MAR&quot; - Margaret Thatcher. But because accounts are
sorted by first name, all the other &quot;Margarets&quot; will be close
at hand. Click on NEXT to verify that this is true - you move to the next
&quot;Margaret&quot; in your membership. Keep clicking NEXT until you've
flipped through all the &quot;Margarets&quot; there are.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This feature is useful when you only have fragmentary
information to go on. It's common for a member to leave a phone message
and say something like &quot;Hi Chris this is Bill… could you please check
that my trade for bike repair went through?&quot; The member assumes you
know which &quot;Bill&quot; it is, but in fact there may be many &quot;Bills&quot;.
The way that LOOKUP sorts accounts often makes it easier to deal with such
messages.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The LOOKUP for phone number, first name, company
name, and joint holder name all work the same way: whichever method you
use for LOOKUP automatically sorts the accounts for viewing in that order.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">And sometimes a garbled phone message is difficult
to understand, except for the phone number. By using the phone number LOOKUP,
you can find them even if you couldn't hear the rest (note that you must
type in EXACTLY the first few digits of a phone number. For instance, the
number &quot;(519) 471-7633 &quot; is not the same as &quot;519.471.7633&quot;,
from the machine's point of view).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">USING COMPANY NAMES</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Try LOOKUP / COMPANY NAME / &quot;WHITE &quot; (type
this in and hit ENTER). Now you jump to Bill clinton's account, who runs
a company called &quot;White House Repair and Comics&quot;. This is an
example of the &quot;company&quot; LOOKUP: it jumps to the nearest company
name that you specify. Hitting NEXT or PRIOR then takes you to other accounts
with similar company names. Note that you must enter a company name in
the appropriate field to enable the software to find it. You may have an
account listed under first name &quot;Bell Canada&quot;, for instance,
but unless you enter Bell under company name as well it won't be searchable
that way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="3dleft.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=26></A><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+3>
<A NAME="enterad"></A></FONT>ENTERING AN AD</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When you choose ADS from Bill Clinton's account screen,
you jump to the first ad that Bill's running, in the &quot;ad screen&quot;.
Like the account screen, this one has a menu at left, letting you jump
to various tasks. For instance, click on NEW AD. Type in some text (you'll
see the cursor blinking in the big empty space at right) and save the ad
by hitting CTRL-END (as mentioned, in the option box at left). Then you
have to choose what &quot;type&quot; of ad it's going to be: &quot;Wanted&quot;
or &quot;Offered&quot;. When you publish the Ad Directory, it will show
all the &quot;wanted&quot; and &quot;offered&quot; ads grouped together,
sorted according to which &quot;ad category&quot; they're listed under
(ie. Home Improvement, Child Care, Plumbing, etc.). But for now, just hit
&quot;W&quot; to create a Want Ad.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Next you're asked which phone number to use for this
ad. The person's home and business numbers are shown, and you can select
one by hitting the appropriate letter (ie. hit H for home number).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, choose the CATEGORY from the list that pops
up. The ad categories shown are merely suggestions. You can customize the
list using SPECIAL TOOLS / PROGRAM SETUP / SETUP AD CATEGORIES. Click on
one of the categories shown, or hit PgDn to view more (usually, the list
of ad categories is too long to fit on the screen). Notice that each category
also has &quot;category number&quot; beside it. The software uses these
category numbers to sort ads prior to publication. For instance, category
&quot;100 Art&quot; will appear before &quot;600 Bikes&quot;. As with category
names, you can setup the numbers any way you wish. Just be sure not to
leave the number blank - the software won't be able to sort ads properly
without it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">After that, the new ad is finished. Notice that every
choice, except the text you typed in, came from a list. This is an intentional
design feature of QLETS, and it means that data errors are kept to a minimum.
You can only choose things from lists you've setup beforehand, which means
that every choice will be valid. Imagine if the data-entry person had to
manually enter the category number for every ad: you might end up with
non-existent category numbers that are time-consuming to fix. And for a
large LETSystem, time spent in data-fixup can seriously affect the level
of service it offers its members (in fact, this is exactly what happened
for years, and one of the reasons QLETS was written. The software aims
to catch any errors [or prevent them] before they cost you time. You'll
see this feature recurring throughout the software).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This example illustrates a very common task: entering
a new ad for someone. First you LOOKUP the person, then choose ADS, then
NEW AD.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ERASING DELETED ADS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">While we're in the ad screen, choose ERASE ALL DELETED
and read the screen that pops up. You should choose this option regularly,
because during the working week, many ads get entered and edited. Although
you don't see it happening, the old copies of those ads get &quot;marked
as deleted&quot;, and take up space in your database. Choosing ERASE ALL
DELETED will clean them out permanently. NOTE: there is no way to retrieve
an old copy of an ad. When you're done editing one, the machine will ask
CHANGES OK? That's your last chance to reverse any changes to an ad. Of
course, you can always just edit it again later.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">PHONE NUMBERS IN ADS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If you try editing an ad, notice that you can also
edit the phone number. In other words, you can put a phone number in here
that is totally different than the one for this person's account. The mismatch
will be picked up when you generate the AD DIRECTORY, and it will pause
to ask if the mismatch should be kept. Mismatching phone numbers on purpose
can be useful where you want to route calls to a voice mail box, or a friend
who's using your account. In most cases, however, if a mismatched phone
number shows up while you compile the AD DIRECTORY, it means that person
has moved recently. In that case, you should answer &quot;no&quot; to the
question &quot;Keep phone mismatch?&quot; and then select the home or business
number shown.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FURTHER EXAMPLES</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This section will take you through a few interesting,
common tasks that you'll end up doing all the time, and some you'll only
use rarely. Each command is listed in this format: 1ST CHOICE / 2ND CHOICE
/ 3RD CHOICE / The Result is...... Each example starts from the main screen.
Make the choices in order and you'll end up at the result described.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FILTER / ALL ACCOUNTS / AD TRADING REPORT / LIST
OF NON-ADVERTISERS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The result is a list of everyone who isn't advertising,
and what their phone numbers are. You can print this screen using SHIFT-PRINTSCRN.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FILTER / ALL ACCOUNTS / AD TRADING REPORT / STANDARD
REPORT</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Similar to the example above, you're looking at the
whole system. This time, however, various statistics have compiled concerning
the overall trading and advertising. At the end of the report, you can
hit F1 for a more in-depth description of what the numbers mean.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FILTER / REGION / DOWNTOWN / AD TRADING REPORT /
STANDARD REPORT</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This example is the same as the last one, except
now you're only looking at the Downtown Region (not All Accounts). Note
that the region has an overall negative balance, but accounts for half
of the overall advertising in the overall system.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FILTER / ALL ACCOUNTS / AD TRADING REPORT / MONTHLY
TRADE BREAKDOWN</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The monthly breakdown is only offered when you're
looking at the overall system. The intro screen talks about what the numbers
mean. This screen is quite useful for figuring out if you pay out more
than you get, per month, and what the &quot;core&quot; group of traders
is in size (the PEOPLE TRADING column lists this core group: members who
trade amongst themselves). The monthly breakdown also shows you how many
member sign-ups you've had each month, and what the amounts are in monthly
trading.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="3dleft.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=26></A><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+3>
<A NAME="directad"></A></FONT>CREATING AN AD DIRECTORY</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FILTER / ALL ACCOUNTS / DIRECTORY / USE THIS COPY
/ COPY TO DISK</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This sequence of choices brings up the most recent
version of the AD DIRECTORY, and prepares you to copy it to a floppy as
a textfile. The AD DIRECTORY is one of the most important functions in
the software: it publishes (or prepares a file for publication), the sum
total of what you want seen when it goes to the membership. The AD DIRECTORY
can also be published whenever you want, for limited copies (that are the
most up-to-date), to distribute to walk-in members in the system office.
Remember that every member is a potential advertiser.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This option produces a textfile which you can use
in other software. Every time you RECOMPILE the Ad Directory, it overwrites
the last version (the machine only stores the most recent directory). Recompiling
the Ad Directory is something you do at the end of the month, normally.
However, you can recompile it every day if you wish, and use the PRINT
option to print it up immediately. Note that we filtered for &quot;all
accounts&quot;, but could just as easily have filtered for a region. Thus
the Ad Directory for &quot;West End Apartments&quot; can be published distinct
from the full listings in the Ad Directory. You may have noticed that one
option in the AD SCREEN is called &quot;SHIELDED&quot;. If you choose that
option, then the ad you're looking at is shielded from the main Ad Directory
(ie. it won't appear). Shielded ads only appear in the regional Ad Directories.
This makes it possible to have a semi-private or private publication, if
some group of traders wants it that way (the &quot;ad shielding&quot; option
has never been used, to my knowledge, and may be dropped from subsequent
versions).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">LOOKUP / COMPANY NAME / &quot;RIGHT&quot; / MEMBER
OF</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The result is you found the &quot;Righteous Lizard
Pet Shop&quot; and looked at which member groups you've assigned them to
(none so far). At screen bottom is a list of options. Choose &quot;edit
Y/N&quot; by hitting the F2 key. Then you can use the arrow keys to go
through the member groups, and add a &quot;yes&quot; beside their names.
This means the pet shop becomes part of that filter group. You can hit
CTRL-END as a shortcut when you're done with the Y/N stuff. Choose MEMBER
OF again and this time hit F10 for &quot;group names&quot;. This lets you
create a new member group. Use the arrow keys to move down to a blank spot,
and type in the member group. When you do FILTER / MEMBER GROUP, you can
call up these groups of people for making lists or charging them a special
fee.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">NOTE: the &quot;member groups&quot; option may seem
a little obscure right now. The main point of a member group is:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1) you can charge them a fee (ie. suppose you had
a project called &quot;Bike Delivery&quot;)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">2) you can track the memo notes you've made (suppose
you create a member group for &quot;Investment&quot;. All of the notes
for them will appear when you use FILTER / MEMBER GROUP/ LIST, and include
&quot;Memos&quot;).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FILTER / MEMBER GROUP / BIKE DELIVERED / CHARGING</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The result is you've called up the group of people
assigned to this member group (using the &quot;yes/no&quot; technique in
the last example), and you're ready to enter a charge just for them. Try
charging them each 1 unit for &quot;bike delivery&quot;. When you're all
done, go back to the main screen and try the next example.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">LOOKUP / ID / &quot;1&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The result is you're looking at the system account
. Now hit &quot;T&quot; - the first letter of the TRADES option. Hitting
the first letter is a shortcut to activate that option. You wind up at
the most recent page of trades involving the system account. If you charged
the BIKE DELIVERED member group as in the last example, you'll see that
the last trade records that group charge. While we're here, let's try entering
a new trade for something else. Click on ADD. Then you must decide if the
LETSystem is the buyer or seller. Next you find their &quot;trading partner&quot;
using the familiar LOOKUP-style menu. Choose FIRST NAME for the LOOKUP,
then type &quot;GEORGE&quot;. You're shown the first George in the list.
Click on NEXT and you move to another George. Then click on THIS ONE to
select him. Finally, fill in the amount and description of the trade and
confirm it. The trade screen will update itself, and the trade is done.
Note that balances for both parties are updated immediately. If George
were to call you up five minutes from now, you could give him his exact
balance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The transaction entry we've just gone through illustrates
one important point: you must select an EXISTING account before you can
credit them. QLETS is designed to avoid bad data before it can happen:
no non-existent accounts can be credited.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now hit ESC to go back to the account screen for
the system. Under &quot;balance&quot; you'll see a field called &quot;trading&quot;.
It tells you the overall amount that has been traded through this account.
Normally, you can't edit the balance or trading amounts, since they're
updated only as trades are entered. In case you need to edit those amounts,
however, there is a way to do it, as shown in the next example.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="3dleft.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=26></A><FONT FACE="Arial">
SPECIAL TOOLS / ENABLE BALANCE EDITING</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The result is (after you put in the password - a
blank line), that you're told &quot;balance / ID editing enabled&quot;.
Now LOOKUP Bill Clinton and choose EDIT. You'll see that his ID number
becomes an editable field, as does the balance and trading for his account.
This utility should be used only rarely.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This utility is used when you have an existing LETSystem
and want to input the starting balances or ID's. Take care to disable the
balance editing (you just choose the option in Special Tools again) when
you're done, and be very careful not to mistakenly change someone's account
number. If you do that, their trades and ads will become disconnected,
or &quot;orphaned&quot; from the account. After you've changed someone's
balance, you must choose RECALCULATE PAST BALANCES - another option in
SPECIAL TOOLS. It will update all the past balances so that each trade
adds up. Note that changing someon'e balance will throw off the overall
total for the system. One good way to check this is run the FILTER / ALL
ACCOUNTS / AD TRADING REPORT / STANDARD REPORT. It shows you what the overall
sum of balances is. If it isn't zero, you should adjust the system account
to make up the difference, and then choose RECALCULATE PAST BALANCES again.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SPECIAL TOOLS / MAKE BACKUP DISKS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The result is a very important screen that you should
use at least once per day. The BACKUP utility copies all data and associated
index and memo files onto four floppies - it prompts you for each one -
and also gives you an indication of whether your trade record needs chopping.
When you see the file QTRANS.DBF (the database of transactions) copying,
note its file size. If it's getting anywhere near the 1.4 MB limit of a
floppy, it's time to chop it down, as shown in the next example.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SPECIAL TOOLS / REMOVE OLD TRADES</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The result is to take you to the chopping screen,
used only rarely (probably not even once per year). This screen shows you
the relative age of different chunks of the transaction record, and allows
to chop out the older portions. Those trades then get copied to a unique
file that looks like this: TROLDn.DBF, where &quot;n&quot; is a number.
The oldest chop is number 1, second oldest is 2, etc. The program doesn't
currently let you load those files back into QLETS, but you can view them
using common database softwares (Visual Basic / Access, Paradox, Foxpro,
dBASE)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">IMPORTANT: if you're running PERCENTAGE FEES (a set
amount paid to your</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">system for every transaction), then the trade record
is DOUBLED in size. This means that you'll want to look at the REMOVE OLD
TRADES option much sooner. The QLETS software can easily handle multiple-year
trading. But unless you've got a tape drive, you will eventually overwhelm
the ability of the MAKE BACKUP DISKS function unless you chop the trade
record down, periodically. The problem is the QTRANS.DBF file - the database
of transactions. It can balloon quickly for a large system (400 - 1000
accounts). In that case, be sure to select REMOVE OLD TRADES whenever the
backup feature becomes overwhelmed </FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="3dleft.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=26></A><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+3>
<A NAME="addmemb"></A></FONT>ADD MEMBER</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The result is you're ready to create a new file for
someone. Fill in their name, address, etc. Decide what TYPE of account
it is (when you get to that field, just keep hitting the Spacebar to cycle
through all of the possible types), and finally choose a region and courier
route. You must choose these last two, but you can have choice called &quot;blank&quot;
if you're not sure which one to choose for them. The list of regions and
routes is setup using SPECIAL TOOLS / PROGRAM SETUP, and then following
the on-screen instructions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SPECIAL TOOLS / PROGRAM SETUP / MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The result is you're ready to set the password, the
default city, area code, system name, and whether you're going to run percentage
fees. The percentage fee kicks in with every trade, and the the amount
collected is dumped into the system account. Note that when you charging
through the FILTER / ALL ACCOUNTS / CHARGING module, the fee per transaction
is just a set amount: a 100 unit trade still collects just .25 (if .25
is the fee you've set per transaction), as with a 10 unit trade. (Any trades
involving the system account are ignored for this charging method). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">But the percentage fee is based on the amount, and
kicks in automatically once you set it using this screen. It's possible
to charge both a percentage and a set fee per trade, along with the usual
ad line charges and flat fee per account found in the charging module.
Overall, the ability to charge is quite flexible. Note that the percentage
fee can be set as &quot;split&quot; (between buyer and seller) or &quot;seller
only&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SPECIAL TOOLS / PROGRAM SETUP / UNLOAD THE FICTIONAL
ACCOUNTS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The result is you prepare your databases for real
data, after you've finished playing around with the many program options
and getting familiar with QLETS. After unloading the fictional accounts,
you're instructed to use the SPECIAL TOOLS / PROGRAM SETUP options to create
categories for your ads, the list of regions and courier routes. If you
just have a small system, you might want to leave regions simple, such
as:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">DT Downtown</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">OT Outside Town</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">OF Office Pickup</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Blank</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Similarly, the courier routes (which appear on the
mailing labels, when you run the</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FILTER / ALL ACCOUNTS / LABELS) can be simple:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">C Courier / Bike</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">M Mail</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">OF Office Pickup</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Larger systems can take advantage of the regions,
routes and member groups to separate their accounts into groups that are
used for printing up neighbourhood Ad Directories, or to assign a group
of delivered mail to different drop-off points. The use of regions and
member groups also lets you see how they perform as a group in terms of
trade and advertising, using the AD TRADING REPORTS (after you've filtered
for that group).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">FILTER / MEMBER GROUP / MEDIA PROJ / LIST</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The result is you're ready to create custom lists
concerning the &quot;Media Project&quot;. First take a peek at &quot;Help
with list options&quot; (the first choice in the menu). Then exit the help
screen by hitting ESC and select &quot;alphabetically by surname&quot;.
Then the box of possible inclusions pops up. These are the kinds of information
you can include in the list. Put a &quot;Y&quot; beside MEMOS? and hit
CTRL-END to continue (you can also keep hitting Enter till you get past
the bottom of the list). Then send the results to SCREEN. Notice that all
the memos from these accounts appear. If you've got a member group you
use for phoning people, then leaving memo notes about those calls, then
LIST becomes a powerful way to pull up all those memos at once. Keep in
mind you must assign each account to the member group (first lookup each
one, then choose MEMBER OF and mark a &quot;yes&quot; beside the group
name, to include them in the group).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The lists are a good method for pinpointing different
things: for instance, you may have a region called &quot;FOOD CO-OP&quot;
(because you want to print up their Ad Directory separately). Using LIST
you can include only the CLOSED ACCOUNTS, with balance and trading, to
find out who's left the co-op and what their final balance was. Or perhaps
include both open and closed accounts, the addresses and referral names
to get a different cross-section of information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">PUBLISHING</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Normally, you enter the ads and trades throughout
the month. Then at month's end you do up the AD DIRECTORY for publishing,
and also the MAILING LABELS and STATEMENTS. All these functions are handled
through FILTER / ALL ACCOUNTS.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To do an AD DIRECTORY, choose FILTER, then ALL ACCOUNTS,
then DIRECTORY. You will be asked to use the pre-existing copy, or RECOMPILE
a new one. Normally, you choose RECOMPILE. Then you have the option of
choosing ALL CATEGORIES or just one. The normal option is ALL CATEGORIES.
Finally, you set the cutoff dates and whether to include names and phone
numbers. The cutoff dates are useful if you want to cut publishing costs
by printing only the recent listings. Remember to hit F1 anywhere if you
need help. For smaller systems, normally you would print all the listings,
so set the</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">cutoff dates way back (1990, for instance). This
will ensure that every ad appears.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Including names and phone numbers is done automatically
if you request it: when</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">entering the ads, remember not to type them in as
part of the ad, if you plan on letting the machine insert them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, all your options are set, and the AD DIRECTORY
begins to compile. It checks for various errors: mismatched phone numbers
(in case someone moved or wanted anonymity or an alternate phone contact),
bad categories (in case you've altered the categories using SPECIAL TOOLS),
and ads from closed accounts. In all these cases, if the machine finds
an error, it pauses and gives you options to fix it on-the-spot. For instance,
a bad category will prompt you to select a new one, while a phone mismatch
lets you update the number.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When it's all done, you can PRINT (dot matrix or
bubble jet) VIEW or COPY TO DISK. The COPY option is the normal one. This
puts the textfile of sorted ads in different formats and copies to a floppy,
which you then use in other publishing software. The PRINT option is mainly
for users with only a cheap old printer. It puts things into three columns
with various fonts that you can set (consult the help there for more info).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ACCOUNT STATEMENTS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When you've got your master copy of the AD DIRECTORY,
you also need to crank out the account statements. Again, you choose FILTER
/ ALL ACCOUNTS then STATEMENTS, and set the cutoff date (how far back the
statements should go), and whether the statements will print to file or
to a printer. All accounts with status set to OPEN will produce a statement
(no NO DELIV or CLOSED accounts will - same for MAILING LABELS). You can
also print up an individual statement from anyone's transaction screen.
First you LOOKUP the person, then choose TRADES, then PRINT.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">MAILING LABELS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The LABELS option lets you choose OPEN, CLOSED, or
both types, and whether you send the labels to a file or a printer. It
also works if you filter for a REGION, which means you can mail to people
who closed their accounts in the region called FOOD CO-OP. The labels produced
are the single-roll type, although a database file is produced called qlabels.dbf
that is suitable for use with external programs, to enable other labels
types.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">OTHER OPTIONS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You'll notice that when you use FILTER, a number
of options come up. Hit the F1 key for a full description of them. Options
like LIST and COUNT, as well as the AD/TRADING report, can tell you who's
not advertising in a given region, or what the overall default rate is,
how many businesses there are downtown, etc. A lot of the usefulness of
these options depends on how you define your regions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">REGIONS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Every account belongs to only one region, although
it could be an apartment building or a business that you decide to call
a region. Using FILTER, you can produce an AD DIRECTORY just for that region,
analyze their trade and advertising patterns, as well as get printed, sorted
lists of who they are and what ranking they have in trading, etc. Regions
are most useful for doing up a &quot;neighbourhood&quot; AD DIRECTORY,
so members can see what's available in their area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Often the regions are setup the same as courier routes:
the same name and same two-letter code. In many cases, though, you may
want courier routes to represent more specific collections of accounts
(ie. everyone in one apartment building).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You setup the regions using SPECIAL TOOLS, then PROGRAM
SETUP, then SETUP REGIONS. Follow the on-screen instructions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">COURIER DELIVERY SYSTEM</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Like regions, courier routes are setup through SPECIAL
TOOLS. When you print the MAILING LABELS, these two-letter codes appear
on the label, so you can sort the envelopes easily into courier piles.
Then the couriers can deliver. (You don't have to run courier delivery,
however. In fact, the courier code is just a way to section off groups
of accounts such that the code appears on the mailing label. Similarly,
you don't need to have regions either, unless you want to take advantage
of the tools in FILTER. The FILTER option keys into the region, courier,
and project codes, if you use them. FILTER can &quot;zero in&quot; on groups
of accounts when those codes are present).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Both region and courier codes are selected when you
ADD MEMBER, or when you choose EDIT from an account screen. After you tab
down to the end of the screen during editing, you're asked if you want
to alter the courier or region information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When you FILTER for COURIER, you get two utilities:
one for showing the size of the courier route (how many people were assigned
to that with EDIT or ADD MEMBER), and one for showing the list of who they
are. The ROUTE SIZE option also runs error scans in the background, to
identify routes that no longer exist.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">From any account screen, you can choose COURIER JOBS
to assign that person to a route. There's a memo window there for notes
about the route, and when you FILTER for COURIER, then choose ROUTE LISTS,
those people will show up as choices, with their names and phone numbers
shown. Courier codes are sometimes setup with the courier's initials and
name (ie. &quot;JS Julie Smith&quot;, rather than &quot;DT Downtown&quot;).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">MEMBER GROUPS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Using member groups, you can list all the memos for
a group of people, which is handy if you're keeping track of some initiative
by leaving memo notes in people's files.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">MEMBER OF is another option from the account screen.
When you choose it, you will see the member group names, and a bunch of
&quot;yes/no&quot; markings. From Bill's account screen, you can see that
he's part of PROJECT 9, and he gets BIKE DELIVERY. To create a new member
group, you can hit F10. Then use the arrow keys to go down to a blank spot,
and type in the new group name. It will now be available to every account
in the database, and appear whenever you choose MEMBER OF. Then you can
mark that account as a &quot;yes&quot;, beside the group name, meaning
they belong to that group.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">An account can belong to any or all of the member
groups. Let's go back to the &quot;main menu&quot; (the very first screen).
Keep hitting ESC to get back there. Now choose FILTER, then MEMBER GROUP,
then choose BIKE DELIVERED. Now choose COUNT. This shows you how many people
you've assigned to the project. Hit ESC and then choose CHARGING. Now you
can charge that group of people - very useful if they receive a special
service that no one else gets (say, a booth at the Trade Fair, that costs
them 5 units).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Member groups provide a way of grouping accounts
more arbitrarily than the region or courier code (each account can only
belong to one courier route or region, while any mix of member groups is
OK).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SETTING UP AD CATEGORIES</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The SPECIAL TOOLS menu is where you setup your ad
categories. The list of</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">categories (like the regions and courier routes)
are the same for casual users, and</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">popup at many points throughout the program. Once
you define these lists, the user cannot choose an invalid entry because
they have to pick from the list. This avoids many data errors before they
can happen. However, you must be careful to select a UNIQUE NUMBER for
each category. If you create categories like this:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">100 Child Care</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">100 Bike Repair</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">...then the computer will not be able to tell them
apart, because it keys into the number portion, not the name. All hell
breaks loose if you have duplicate numbers (or leave the number portion
blank). The categories will appear in number order when you set them up,
so you can see if there are any duplicates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">OTHER LISTS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">By using FILTER, then selecting a group, then LIST,
you have access to a mix-and-match utility for sorting that group on various
criteria. Also, you can choose what data to include in the list (address,
business name, balance and trading, etc.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ENTERING TRADES</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To enter a trade, you find someone's account using
LOOKUP, then choose TRADES, then click on ADD. If that person has a company
name, you can select that for the trade. The person they're trading with
will see the truncated company name on their account statement for that
trade. Similarly, the joint holder name can be chosen. This feature only
works when the person you lookup first is the point from which you enter
the trade.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Once you've decided if the first trader is buyer
or seller, you're asked to search for the trading partner. As with LOOKUP,
you can search using a variety of data: first name, company name, ID, etc.
The nearest match is found, but you can surf through near misses in case
there are many &quot;Smiths&quot;, for instance. Then click on THIS ONE,
then specify the amount and description. You're asked to confirm and shown
any percentage fee that applies. Then the trade is written into the record,
and balances are adjusted immediately.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">BACKUP / RESTORE / REINDEX</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Using the SPECIAL TOOLS menu, you can perform the
four-disk backup of all files and related data. You should do this at the
end of every working day. Purchase of a UPS (uninterruptible power supply)
is also recommended to prevent corruption of data files. The REINDEX option
is added to rebuild data indexes that are vital to proper program operation.
You can perform a reindex as often as you wish.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SETTING REMINDERS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">From anyone's account screen, you can choose SET
REMINDER, and you will be</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">adding to the reminders database. Reminders can be
viewed as a group through</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">LOOKUP, and you can limit the view to those marked
URGENT, or just those for one staff member. There are three ways to set
the date for the reminder - choose ABOUT THIS SCREEN for more information.
It's possible to send a reminder to some other staff member by specifying
their initials under STAFF, at the end. Reminders are similar to memos,
but they don't automatically appear when you view a person's account screen,
the way that memos do.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ACCOUNT TYPES AND STATUS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Everyone in your database doesn't have to be a member:
you can set the account</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">TYPE to PROSPECT, and they will be ignored for charges,
advertising, etc. However, you'll still have their phone/fax/memo notes
at your fingertips using LOOKUP. Accounts with status = NO DELIV do not
generate a statement or mailing label, for those people who want to be
members but don't want &quot;junk mail&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The ACTYPE (account type) can be PERSONAL, BUSINESS,
NON-PROFIT, NO</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">CHARGE, PROSPECT, OR JOINT. These codes are primarily
used for the COUNT option found through FILTER, to give you an idea of
the cross-section of membership for a given region, or for ALL ACCOUNTS.
However, the NO CHARGE type will be ignored for normal charging. It's also
possible to specify a company name, but to forget to change the STATUS
to BUSINESS: the program doesn't do it for you. The LIST utility, however,
tests to see if the company name contains any characters, so it's a more
accurate way of zeroing in on companies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">TRADING WITH CLOSED ACCOUNTS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The program allows you to register a trade with a
closed account, but it informs you of that, and then generates a warning
line in the statement of the person they traded with.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">TIPS AND MISC.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When you're editing someone's account screen, you
can hit CTRL-END as a shortcut to save the changes, and skip the final
questions of &quot;Alter the neighbourhood?&quot; and &quot;Alter the Courier
Route?&quot;. Note that &quot;neighbourhood&quot; is used interchangeably
with &quot;region&quot;, although you can setup regions to mean something
different than a geographical area (ie. a region could be an organization
like &quot;Vegetarian Association&quot;).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Many sections involving long calculations or summation
of data can be aborted by</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">hitting any key.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You can invoke a menu option quickly by hitting the
first letter of the option. For</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">instance, in the account screen menu you can hit
&quot;E&quot; and the EDIT option will begin. Note that where two options
have the same first letter, the one below that's closest will be invoked.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">UNLOADING THE FICTIONAL ACCOUNTS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When you first receive QLETS, it comes loaded with
a fictional database for you to play around with. When you've read this
User Manual, played around with the software options (a number of examples
are given below), and feel ready to start &quot;for real&quot;, choose
the option UNLOAD THE FICTIONAL ACCOUNTS. This option is found in the SPECIAL
TOOLS menu. Unloading the fictional accounts will prepare your databases
so you can begin entering real data.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">CODE PAGE ERROR</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You may see a message when you start QLETS up: &quot;system
is not configured for</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">current code page&quot; and then the option to quit
or continue. Choose &quot;continue&quot; and the program will begin. The
code page relates to the character set your keyboard is using. In the modern
era, computer keyboards can be configured for a variety of languages. However,
dBASE IV (the computer language used to write QLETS) uses an older, standard
code page - which includes non-English characters - and it sometimes pops
up the message &quot;code page error&quot; when you start the software.
This isn't an error in the true sense: it won't affect the operation of
QLETS. It's really an artifact of an earlier time in computing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">For information about using non-English language
characters in QLETS, see Section I: Non-English Language Characters Included.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">OUT OF MEMORY ERROR</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If you have a problem starting up QLETS (ie. you
get an &quot;out of memory&quot; message or something similar), then it's
probably a conflict with the Virtual Memory Manager. Check out the section
below entitled &quot;About the VMM (Virtual Memory Manager)&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ABOUT THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Version 8 comes with a free inspection period - generally
1-2 months, after which it will expire. Expiry does not affect your machine,
except that QLETS itself won't load past the registration screen. Installation
of QLETS does not alter your configuration files, so erasing the software
is just a matter of erasing the entire c:\ql8 directory.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The inspection copy is identical in function to a
registered copy. You can contact me to obtain the matching code which registers
your copy for unlimited use - see Section I: How to Contact Me.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ABOUT THE VMM (VIRTUAL MEMORY MANAGER)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A virtual memory manager (VMM) is included with this
copy of QLETS, to allow it to run concurrently in Windows 3.1 with other
software. Without the VMM, QLETS can only run alone from the DOS prompt,
unless you have 8 RAM, in which case it might &quot;sqeak by&quot; in Windows.
By using the VMM, however, memory requirements are much reduced.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The VMM is currently set for a typical 4 RAM machine,
but can be set for as little as 2 RAM. It may conflict with disk-caching
software, however, including SMARTDRIVE, a common disk-cache that may well
be running on your system. (SMARTDRIVE is shipped with Microsoft Windows).
If you are unable to start up QLETS, it's likely due to this memory conflict.
There are two ways to fix it, should this happen to you. You can: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1) disable SMARTDRIVE (or whatever disk-caching program
is running on your</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">system), or</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">2) disable the VMM supplied with QLETS (by erasing
the file C:\QL8\QLETS.VMC)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Disabling SMARTDRIVE involves editing your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file, to convert the line that loads SMARTDRIVE into a comment, by typing
&quot;REM&quot; in front of it. For example, my AUTOEXEC file contained
the line:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE 1024 256</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">which was changed to: REM C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE
1024 256</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It's useful, but not essential, to edit the QLETS.VMC
file, (you can use any text editor, like Notepad, for example) which contains
explanations of the settings. If the QLETS.VMC file is present - ie. not
erased - then the VMM will be activated. The MAXMEM and MINMEM settings
can be increased if you have more than 4 RAM. For information on SMARTDRIVE,
type &quot;help&quot; from the c:\ and look at the entry describing it.
The downside of disabling SMARTDRIVE (and using the QLETS VMM instead),
is slower computer operation, especially when groups of files are copied
or moved. The upside is you'll be able to use Alt-Tab in Windows to switch
between other software and QLETS while keeping them all running at once.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The other option is to keep SMARTDRIVE in place,
and remove the file QLETS.vmc from the C:\QL8 directory. If you do this,
the virtual memory manager in QLETS will be disabled. You must then include
the SET DOS16M=:2M in your CONFIG.SYS file. This is a DOS environmental
variable that sets how much extended memory is available for DOS-based
programs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Disabling the VMM this way means, for most users,
that QLETS must run alone from the DOS prompt.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ABOUT THE PASSWORD</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The password shipped is &quot; &quot; (blank spaces).
When you find an option that is</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">password-protected, it will offer a blank space by
default, so just hit Enter. You can</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">change the password using the SPECIAL TOOLS / PROGRAM
SETUP / MISC. SETTINGS. If you've forgotten the password completely, you
can contact me to find out how to retrieve it easily.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">DISCLAIMER</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There is no express or implied warranty on the software:
QLETS version 8 is offered &quot;as is&quot;. It has been extensively field
tested and is, to the best of my knowledge and ability, a stable product.
I try to respond to e-mail within 24-hours, subject to the volume of requests,
and have gone to great lengths to fix existing problems within the software.
QLETS has gone through eight upgrades and years of heavy use in some of
the largest LETSystems in Canada.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Registering your QLETS version 8 confers a site license
to use the version as it</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">stands on a single machine indefinitely, and does
not imply transfer of source code or copyright, or permission to redistribute
the software.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">MANUAL SOFTWARE INSTALLATION</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If you have difficulty installing QLETS you can do
it manually by:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1) creating a directory called C:\QL8</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">2) copying all files from the three installation
disks into it</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">3) typing DJOIN QLETS from the C:\QL8 prompt. This
reassembles the file</FONT></P>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">QLETS.EXE. After it's finished you can erase the
fragments QLETS.001 and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">QLETS.002 (which are both large files), to conserve
space on your hard drive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ABOUT THE UPGRADE UTILITY</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The SPECIAL TOOLS menu contains a utility to upgrade
from a previous version: SPECIAL TOOLS / CONVERT DATA / QLETS VERSIONS
1.0 TO 1.7. Version 8 stores its files in a new directory (C:\QL8), so
your old copy of QLETS won't be affected. You can run old and new versions
simultaneously, but keep in mind they're working from different data files:
any changes you make in the older copy won't be reflected in the new version,
unless you run the CONVERT DATA utility. Any new data you've put in 1.7
is lost whenever you run the conversion utility. If you've registered your
copy of version 8, it's a good idea to move older versions of QLETS into
backup directories to prevent accidental use of the conversion utility.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ERROR TRAPPING</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Many sections in the program run error scans in the
background. Most notable are the ROUTE SIZE option in COURIER, the AD/TRADING
REPORT, the process of creating an AD DIRECTORY, and RECALCULATE PAST BALANCES,
which restores the pointers for first and last trades (internally) and
also updates balances in case of weirdness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">CHARGING REGIONS SEPARATELY</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">QLETS does not enforce a zero-balance within regions.
You can charge and publish separately for a region, however. If you charge
separately, keep in mind that when you choose ALL ACCOUNTS charging, all
regions will get charged again. For that reason, it's recommended that
if you charge one region some unique mix of fees, then you should charge
each region one at a time, to avoid duplication.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">CHARGING IN GENERAL</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The usual method is FILTER / ALL ACCOUNTS / CHARGING.
Then you select the mix of fees: by the adline, per trade, per account,
or any mix. Also, some fees can be credits instead of charges. You can
charge a project (remember projects are collections of accounts you create
by putting a &quot;yes&quot; beside the project name, in that person's
account screen), or credit it as a group.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The adline charge assumes 40 characters per &quot;line&quot;.
When you use the textfile</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">generated for the AD DIRECTORY, the line length may
end up a different number of characters, depending on how you set the margins
for the final document. However, the charging module runs in multiples
of 40 characters. You can set a cutoff (say, 3 lines), beyond which a higher
fee per line is charged. Be sure to consult the help screens in the CHARGING
section for more information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">PRINT TO FILE FOR STATEMENTS AND LABELS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Choose FILTER / ALL ACCOUNTS / STATEMENTS. You'll
now notice there's a &quot;print to file option&quot;. The finished file
is useful for those systems who experience printer conflicts in Windows
95, and for those who want to polish the look of ststements with fonts
from a Windows word processing program before printing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The statements produced through this option are also
narrower to fit A4 paper. The finished textfile is called C:\QL8\ST_ALL.TXT
(there's a note on the screen to remind you of that), and it contains all
account statements, one after the other, ordered by ID (the same order
that mailing labels use). There's still no option to &quot;pad&quot; shorter
statements with blank lines so that they print easily in sheet feeder style
(the statements work best with tractor-fed paper), but let me know if you
want that changed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The statement file skips account #1 - the system
account - but you can print that up separately by looking up account 1
and choosing TRADES / PRINT. If you're not using account number 1 for your
system account, you should: the FILTER / ALL ACCOUNTS / CHARGING won't
work properly unless your system uses account #1 for admin. The next version
will be adding an option for multiple system accounts (for administering
separate currencies), in which the system accounts can be assigned.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Similarly, the mailing labels now have a &quot;print
to file&quot; option. Note that mailing labels print in the same order
(ID order) that statements do, so if you're stuffing envelopes, both labels
and statements will be synchronized. (It's been suggested in the past that
an option to print in courier code order would speed up the envelope stuffing;
that's still on the back burner compared to some other options in development).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The two-letter code that appears on labels is the
&quot;courier code&quot; that occurs in every member's account. It's designed
to let you sort the envelopes into &quot;courier piles&quot; once they've
been stuffed with statements and ad directories. To assign a member as
a courier, LOOKUP their account and choose COURIER JOBS; to view which
accounts are assigned to which courier routes choose FILTER / COURIER /
ROUTE LISTS. Note that sometimes the ROUTE SIZE option in the same menu
doesn't display properly unless you REINDEX the data. You can create or
edit courier routes using SPECIAL TOOLS / PROGRAM SETUP / SETUP COURIER
ROUTES. Remember if you forget your password you can hit F10 to reveal
it (not meant to be high-level security!).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">PROJECTS EXPANDED AND RENAMED</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Choose LOOKUP / (someone's account). Where the &quot;Projects&quot;
option used to be, now it says &quot;Member Of&quot;. In other respects
the option is identical. It allows you to create member groups (usually
for special charges, which you can run using FILTER / MEMBER GROUPS / CHARGING),
and assign each account as belonging to some, none or all of the member
groups you specify. The member groups are being expanded to include independent
currency systems (to be released in the next version), which is why the
name &quot;Projects&quot; was changed to &quot;Member Of&quot;. Member
groups are also more numerous: there are 4 new ones available, for a total
of 18 (Projects only had 14).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">DELETE OPTION FOR TRADES</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Choose LOOKUP / (someone's account) / TRADES. You'll
notice there's a new option called DELETE. This option removes a trade
permanently (you select which one from those shown on the current page
of trades), and balances and overall trading are automatically adjusted,
as well as any past balances that might be affected. If you experience
any problems in the trade screen display, try SPECIAL TOOLS / RECALCULATE
PAST BALANCES. This option repairs the display for all accounts in case
of problems (it updates the internal &quot;markers&quot; for each account
that store the location of their last trade. This &quot;last trade&quot;
value is used for screen display and statement printout, so it's important
that it be accurate. The option RECALCULATE PAST BALANCES can take a while
when there are many trades [remember you can REMOVE OLD TRADES - and should
do so once a year or so], but it is very effective at ensuring that transactions
display and print properly, by rigorously checking that all &quot;last
trade&quot; values are internally correct).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">ERRANT SPACES IN TEXTFILE FIXED</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Choose FILTER / ALL ACCOUNTS / DIRECTORY / either
RECOMPILE or USE THIS COPY. As usual, this is the option to produce an
Ad Directory or use the existing copy. The difference is that when you
choose COPY TO DISK, the problem with spaces being inserted inappropriately
has been fixed. The finished file is C:\QL8\LETS_ADS.TXT (and there's now
a note at the top of the screen to alert you to that). Now you can copy
this file anywhere on your hard drive, under any name. It's probably good
practice to archive your old Ad Directories somewhere on the hard drive
(ie. create a directory called C:\ADS, with subdirectories like C:\ADS\FEB97,
C:\ADS\MAR97, etc. Then copy the LETS_ADS.TXT file for that month into
the appropriate directory).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;ONE FREE ADLINE&quot; PROBLEM FIXED</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A bug was fixed involving charging for ads, where
you want to set the &quot;cutoff line&quot; at one line. Previously you
would enter a one-line cutoff for the basic ad charge, and the software
would assume you meant two lines. That's now fixed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">PERCENTAGE FEES AND &quot;NOCHARGE ACCOUNTS&quot;
FIXED</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;Nocharge&quot; accounts are now exempt from
percentage fees on each trade. Percentage fees are still applied after
every trade, which increases the size of the trade record, sometimes compromising
the BACKUP utility's ability to copy files to floppy (use REMOVE OLD TRADES
to chop the trade record down). A good suggestion was made to have the
software apply percentage fees monthly rather than with every trade, but
to date that option is unwritten.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SYSTEM NAME ADDED</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When you CONVERT data from an earlier QLETS, or UNLOAD
THE FICTIONAL ACCOUNTS, you're now prompted for the &quot;system name&quot;.
This name now gets inserted in descriptions of trade involving account
#1, replacing the generic &quot;LETS&quot; or &quot;LETSystem&quot; that
used to appear. For instance, if your currency system goes by the acronym
&quot;BYTS&quot;, then any trades involving account #1 will show &quot;BYTS&quot;
as the trading partner. You can change the system name using SPECIAL TOOLS
/ PROGRAM SETUP / MISC. SETTINGS.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE CHARACTERS INCLUDED</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Some currency systems use international characters
(Swedish, French or German vowels), which are now connected to the function
keys. Hitting SHIFT-F3, for instance, inserts the letter &auml; in the
text of ads (it doesn't work in the memo window, or in the setup screens
for courier routes, ad categories, or regions).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Here's a list of the special characters available
and which key combinations to press:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SHIFT-F1 = &uuml; CTRL-F1 = &Uuml;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SHIFT-F2 = &iuml; CTRL-F2 = &eacute;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SHIFT-F3 = &auml; CTRL-F3 = &Auml;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SHIFT-F4 = &ouml; CTRL-F4 = &Ouml;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SHIFT-F5 = &euml; CTRL-F5 = &ecirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SHIFT-F6 = &egrave; CTRL-F6 = &ccedil;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SHIFT-F7 = &yuml; CTRL-F7 = &uacute;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SHIFT-F8 = &aring; CTRL-F8 = (none)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">SHIFT-F9 = &ntilde; CTRL-F9 = &aacute;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">These settings can be found in a textfile called
C:\QL8\CONFIG.DB, which QLETS reads when it first starts up. By editing
the settings in that file you can rearrange which keys do what. (IMPORTANT:
if you look at the CONFIG.DB file, you'll notice that the plain function
keys are not assigned. This is because QLETS assigns functions to those
keys depending on which screen the user is currently viewing. I would recommend
NOT assigning any special characters to the normal function keys, but only
to key combinations).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">IMPORTANT: if you use international characters in
your ads, you must select a new option when creating the Ad Directory textfile.
The option is called ASCII CHARACTER CONVERSION, and occurs in the COPY
TO DISK phase.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You should answer &quot;YES&quot; to ASCII CHARACTER
CONVERSION (hit the Spacebar to toggle between yes and no). The conversion
does not affect the actual ads themselves, but only the finshed textfile,
so that it can be used in other Windows software (Word, Wordperfect, Wordpad,
Notepad, Pagemaker, etc.) and display the ads correctly. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When you choose ASCII CHARACTER CONVERSION, you can
convert each special character one-by-one (the program searches through
all ads looking for it, and converts every instance in the textfile; you're
given a chart showing suggested values to try), or you can simply hit F10
to convert all special characters automatically, using the default settings
I've programmed in. Although I've tested these default settings as far
as I can, they may need to be adjusted if you experience weird conversions.
In that case, the option to convert them one-by-one can be used experimentally,
trying out different ASCII values to see which ones work. I'm fairly sure
I have the default settings right, though.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To summarize, the international characters can be
inserted in ad text with function keys (or inserted in someone's account
file, for instance in their name). Then when you compile an Ad Directory,
you choose ASCII CHARACTER CONVERSION in the COPY TO DISK phase, and hit
F10. That's the only extra step (at least in theory!).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Also, there's one way to test if the ASCII CHARACTER
CONVERSION is working</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">properly: do up a textfile WITHOUT the character
conversion, then open it from the DOS prompt (ie. EDIT C:\QL8\LETS_ADS.TXT).
Opening the textfile in DOS software will show the special characters as
they appear in QLETS. As an experiment, open the same file in Word or Notepad.
You'll see that the vowels DO NOT appear properly (because no character
conversion was done). Go back and do the textfile again, this time WITH
character conversion. Open the finished file in Notepad or Word, and it
should appear EXACTLY like the first version (without conversion) that
you opened using the DOS &quot;EDIT&quot; command. If the two copies don't
match, there's a problem, and you'll have to try converting the characters
one-by-one with the utility provided.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, there's a new prompt to copy the finished
textfile to some spot on your hard drive (it used to just copy to a disk
in A:\).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Other characters can be assigned through function
keys as well - let me know if you need any characters not already included.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">NOTE: try not to use the special characters in the
descriptions of trades. They won't appear properly on statements unless
you print the statement file by using the MS-DOS EDIT program: you'd go
to the DOS prompt, type</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">EDIT C:\QL8\ST_ALL.TXT and choose print from there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Using a Windows program to print the statement file
will only display the trade descriptions properly if they do not contain
special characters, at this point. Moreover, you should only print the
statements from the file created using the new &quot;print to file&quot;
option for statements, for the moment. The statement printout direct from
QLETS included the ads, and I haven't had time to put an ASCII CHARACTER
CONVERSION together for the statements yet, only the Ad Directory.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Other than that, the software is essentially the
same. As always I look forward to your comments and questions that help
in the software's evolution.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">MISCELLANEOUS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">WINDOWS 95 AND QLETS: Users of Windows 95 sometimes
point out that the colours in QLETS don't display through Win95 in a readable
fashion. This can be fixed by hitting the &quot;Full Screen&quot; button
on the status bar at top, which displays QLETS as it normally appeared
running through older versions of Windows. However, you then lose the Win
95 Taskbar at bottom and the toolbar at top. The toolbar is especially
useful when you want to cut-and-paste text (or entire screens) from QLETS
into another software package. Moreover, once you hit the &quot;full screen&quot;
button on the toolbar (causing the toolbar to vanish), it's difficult to
retrieve it without creating a new shortcut to QLETS in Win95 (to create
a shortcut, rightclick on your desktop and select NEW / SHORTCUT / BROWSE
and find the file c:\ql8\QLETS.exe).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Perhaps the best solution to the &quot;funny colours&quot;
vs. Toolbar dilemma is to have two shortcuts - one where &quot;full screen&quot;
has been clicked (restoring the normal QLETS colours), and one without
(where the Toolbar and Taskbar are still present).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">MOUSE TIP: the mouse works on many menus and lists,
and it's also a faster way to open the memo window than hitting Ctrl-Home.
As well, it repositions the cursor within the memo window. Using the mouse
can speed up displaying the Ad / Skills Lists through Lookup, choosing
an option on the transaction menu, a person's account menu, or in the ad
menu.</FONT></P>
